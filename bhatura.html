        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt and oil or ghee to the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Gradually add warm water and knead the mixture into a soft, pliable dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>After resting, divide the dough into small balls.</li>
        <li>Roll each ball into a flat, round disc about 6-8 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully slide one bhatura into the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry until it puffs up and turns golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the bhatura from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with chole (spiced chickpea curry) or your favorite side dish.</li>
